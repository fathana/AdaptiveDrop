# AdaptiveDrop

This repository is for our paper entitled "ADAPTIVEDROP: A SIMPLE ADAPTIVE LABEL NOISE FILTERING SCHEME
FOR ENHANCED SELF-SUPERVISED SPEAKER VERIFICATION" currently under review.

Code of our experiments will be available upon acceptance of our paper. We also include below additional ablation studies for our proposed AdaptiveDrop filtering framework.
